Party Girl
Summary of Movie:Although Mary (Parker Posey) has little income, she still finds ways to spend her nights at clubs. After being arrested for throwing an illegal rave, she asks her aunt Judy (Sasha von Scherler) for bail money. Judy then finds Mary a job at her library so that Mary can repay her. Initially, Mary finds the job as a clerk boring and stifling, and prefers to get to know a street food vendor (Omar Townsend) whom she likes. However, Mary must refocus her life once she loses her job and apartment.

Parker Posey brought enviable indie-girl style to the part, morphing from club kid to librarian, and we're still inspired by her colorful, highly individual looks, as envisioned by costume designer Michael Clancy. Think leopard prints and feather-embellished platforms, a lipstick-red miniskirt, aquamarine gloves—all of which are so good you won't even bother to long for, as Mary does at one point_,_ “a nice, powerful, mind-altering substance,” when you start planning to celebrate the season in style.
